A better method to open files is with the fopen() function. 
This function gives you more options than the readfile() function.

The fgets() function is used to read a single line from a file.

r -> for read only.pointer starts at the beginning of the file

w -> for write only. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. 
    File pointer starts at the beginning of the file

a -> Open a file for write only. The existing data in file is preserved. 
    File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist.

x -> Creates a new file for write only. Returns FALSE and an error if file already exists
